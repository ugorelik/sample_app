Shit I found out

	attr_accesible simple means that it can be access and changed through the browser
	
	The bang method for create does the same thing except it throws an exception. This is useful for testing since we don't have to evaluate a boolean expression. Test fail upon exceptions being thrown. We could use the non bang version and then check if it was created successfully.
	
	We use factories because they let us bypass a lot of things that we aren't supposed to. Stuff like attr_accessible (which are attributes that can be set through a browser). 
		For instance we can directly set a user to be an admin by doing:
		
		User.create!(:name => "Foo Bar", :email => "foobar@example.com"
					 :password => "foobar", password-confirmation=> "foobar",
					 :admin => 1)
					
		Normally the 'admin => 1' wouldn't do anything but a factory ignores it and allows it to be done.
		
		Good for testing.
